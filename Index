		Hello, my name is Cody Puskas. I am a student at Miami Valley Career Technology Center and I am in game programming and web design. <br/>
		I hope to do the best I can do at any job I have. I am a hard worker and will do whatever it takes <br/>
		to get my projects done.

	<h2> Educational Goals: </h2> <br/>
	<p> 
		Two S.M.A.R.T. educational goals of mine are to go to a 4 year college. And earn a masters or bachelors degree.<br/>
		To help me achieve these goals, I went to Miami Valley Career Technology Center to learn more about computer languages <br/>
		and to further my education to help be successful in life. I want to further my education either at Miami University <br/>
		or Wright State University to earn a bachelors or masters in Computer Science (WSU) or Software Engineering (MU).
		
	</p>
	<h2> Employment Goals: </h2> <br/>
	<p>
		Two S.M.A.R.T. employment goals that I have set for myself are work hard at whatever challenges me and <br/>
		to help the technological field grow. I want to be employed in a positive enviroment because I am <br/>
		a very positive person. I like working in groups and I would like being challenged with big projects. <br/>
		I want to have a successful future so I will also help others be successful on the way.
