				Hello, my name is Cody Puskas. I am a student at Miami Valley Career Technology Center and I am in game programming and web design. <br/>

			<p> 
				Two S.M.A.R.T. educational goals of mine are to go to a 4 year college. And earn a masters or bachelors degree.<br/>
				To help me achieve these goals, I went to Miami Valley Career Technology Center to learn more about computer languages <br/>
				and to further my education to help be successful in life. I want to further my education either at Miami University <br/>
				or Wright State University to earn a bachelors or masters in Computer Science (WSU) or Software Engineering (MU).

			<p>
				Two S.M.A.R.T. employment goals that I have set for myself are work hard at whatever challenges me and <br/>
				to help the technological field grow. I want to be employed in a positive enviroment because I am <br/>
				a very positive person. I like working in groups and I would like being challenged with big projects. <br/>
				I want to have a successful future so I will also help others be successful on the way. I hope to find <br/>
				this job when I graduate high school or when I get into college. I will need a job to pay for my college.
