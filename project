					<td>Body Mass Index Calculator</td>
					<td>The body mass index(BMI) calculator first asks for your height(inches) and weight(pounds). Then the calculator converts<br/>
						inches into meters and pounds into kilograms. From those calculations, it will tell you your BMI and if your are under weight, <br/>
						optimal weight, or over weight. After all of these calculations, the program asks you if your are a male or female.After the <br/>
						users input if they are male or female, it will then ask you if you are an active person meaning if you excersise daily or if you <br/>
						are inactive. From the input of the user, the program will output the calculated caloric intake daily recommended for them. <br/>
						I am very proud of this program and plan on making more like this for people to use at home. This project was more serious than <br/> 
						any other project I have done. I put many hours into making this program. I wouldn't change anything to it. </td>

				The image to the left is an example of my BMI calculator working. Those numbers are examples to show you that my it runs smoothly.
				My body mass index calculator can calculate your BMI. If you need to calculate that, download the program 
				<a href="projects/bmi.zip">here</a>. It takes about 3 minutes to do so hopefully it wont waste your time.
