					<td> Adventure Game </td>
					<td> For our final project for C++, also our biggest project, we had to create a text based game. It had to consist of <br/>
						different rooms to travel through and eventually fight a boss. It was a really fun project and I enjoyed playing <br/>
						it. Once I created it and finished it, I was very proud of myself because I learned new code for C++. I could have <br/>
						improved on the layout and story of the game. It is still one of my best projects I have done.  </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Body Mass Index Calculator</td>
					<td>The body mass index(BMI) calculator first asks for your height(inches) and weight(pounds). Then the calculator converts<br/>
						inches into meters and pounds into kilograms. From those calculations, it will tell you your BMI and if your are under weight, <br/>
						optimal weight, or over weight. After all of these calculations, the program asks you if your are a male or female.After the <br/>
						users input if they are male or female, it will then ask you if you are an active person meaning if you excersise daily or if you <br/>
						are inactive. From the input of the user, the program will output the calculated caloric intake daily recommended for them. <br/>
						I am very proud of this program and plan on making more like this for people to use at home. This project was more serious than <br/> 
						any other project I have done. I put many hours into making this program. I wouldn't change anything to it. </td>

				<tr>
					<td> Other Projects on the way </td>
					<td> I have many other C++ projects done. I will have them uploaded with a description and name soon. :) </td>

				The image to the left is an example of my adventure game running. The game has some still has some bugs so don't panic if something
				 doens't work right.It is a short and fun game to play. 
				If you want to relieve some stress, click <a href="projects/adventureGame.zip">here</a>. It will take about 5 minutes to 
				complete the game. There is only one way to win. Good luck, have fun.

			<p>
				The image to the left is an example of my BMI calculator working. Those numbers are examples to show you that my it runs smoothly.
				My body mass index calculator can calculate your BMI. If you need to calculate that, download the program 
				<a href="projects/bmi.zip">here</a>. It takes about 3 minutes to do so hopefully it wont waste your time.
