					<td> Adventure Game </td>
					<td> For our final project for C++, also our biggest project, we had to create a text based game. It had to consist of <br/>
						different rooms to travel through and eventually fight a boss. It was a really fun project and I enjoyed playing <br/>
						it. Once I created it and finished it, I was very proud of myself because I learned new code for C++. I could have <br/>
						improved on the layout and story of the game. It is still one of my best projects I have done.  </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Body Mass Index Calculator</td>
					<td>The body mass index(BMI) calculator first asks for your height(inches) and weight(pounds). Then the calculator converts<br/>
						inches into meters and pounds into kilograms. From those calculations, it will tell you your BMI and if your are under weight, <br/>
						optimal weight, or over weight. After all of these calculations, the program asks you if your are a male or female.After the <br/>
						users input if they are male or female, it will then ask you if you are an active person meaning if you excersise daily or if you <br/>
						are inactive. From the input of the user, the program will output the calculated caloric intake daily recommended for them. <br/>
						I am very proud of this program and plan on making more like this for people to use at home. This project was more serious than <br/> 
						any other project I have done. I put many hours into making this program. I wouldn't change anything to it. </td>

				<tr>
					<td> Other Projects on the way </td>
					<td> I have many other C++ projects done. I will have them uploaded with a description and name soon. :) </td>

				My adventure game is a short and fun game to play. <br/>
				If you want to relieve some stress, click <a href="projects/adventureGame.zip">here</a>. It will <br/>
				take about 5 minutes to complete the game. There is <br/>
				only one way to win. Good luck, have fun.

			<p style="float:right; position:relative; margin-right:350px; border-style:solid; border-color:#33ccff">
				My body mass index calculator can calculate your <br/>
				BMI. If you need to calculate that, download the <br/>
				program <a href="projects/bmi.zip">here</a>. It takes about 3 minutes to do so <br/>
				hopefully it wont waste your time.
