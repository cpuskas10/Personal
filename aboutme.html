			<p> 
				Hi, my name is Cody Puskas and I am 16 years old. Before I came to Miami Valley Career Technology 
				Center, I went to Brookville High School. At Brookville, I will have a graduating class of about
			 	100 students. I grew up in Columbus, Ohio, living in a nice litte neighborhood. I moved to Brookville
			 	in 2008 because of my parents job. I have always been interested in technology and when I got
			 	my first computer, I learned as much as I could. I spend a lot of time outside of school on the
			 	computer. I also play soccer all year round and I love playing video games. During my sophomore
			 	year of high school, I started learning my first form of computer language, HTML. Ever since
			 	learning computer code, I have always had a drive to pursue that career and is that is what
			 	I plan to do.

				This is a wordle that I created myself. All of these words roughly describe what I love to do and characteristics about myself.
				Hover over the picture if you can't see the words very well.
